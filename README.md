# Description:
Pseudo-Numix-Black-Edition is a modern flat theme, which is a combination of dark elements, but without the high amount of orange elements (like in the original Numix). Included files are for Cinnamon, GTK-2.0, GTK-3.0 or Metacity.

# Manual installation:
1. If you want to install this theme, just extract this zip file to the themes directory, in example `~/.themes`.

2. Next, you must go to System Settings â†’ Themes and in the "Installed" tab, choose Pseudo-Numix-Black-Edition from the list. After that, go to "Other Settings" and choose Pseudo-Numix-Black-Edition on the "Controls" and "Window borders" drop-downs.

# Requirements:
Tested on Cinnamon 2.4, but everything works in any Desktop Environment, which supports GTK-2.0, GTK-3.0 or Metacity.
